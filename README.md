## Circuit Design

The image below shows the circuit design for this project. It includes wiring for LEDs representing red, yellow, and green lights, each connected to appropriate resistors to limit current and protect the components.

## How to Run

1. Connect the components as shown in the circuit design image.
2. Change the input pins respectively.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino/ESP.
4. The lights start to work automatically
5. You can change the green light time for each traffic light by inputting `green1: %d` or `green2: %d` respectively.
